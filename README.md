# FFmpeg-Command-Generator
A simple utility app that lets you generate FFmpeg commands based on input video and audio links.
You can [download on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ffmpeg-command-generator/id6444012595), view the [website](https://www.sunapps.org/ffmpeg-generator), or clone and run locally.

Supports iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple Vision Pro, with a custom-tailored interface for each. Created with UIKit.

If locally running the Mac version on your machine, you can change the `useAppleScript` variable at the top of `AppDelegate` to true to enable one-click running of your generated command in Terminal. Use at your own risk. Note: this feature is unavaliable in the App Store version due to Apple restrictions.
